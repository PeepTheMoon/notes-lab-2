// For the notes module tests, you will need to assert the following:
// Nothing is returned if no command given
// If the command and data were both valid, assert that a note is returned (a note is an object { text: 'My Note' }) Use the following files/structure


// Exports an execute function
// execute takes an action and chooses
// How will you use that object to run the correct method?
// You can predict that add won't be the only action we're going to have to handle...
// write an add function that will create an object representing a note (with an ID and the note text as properties) and console.log the text of the note to be added when the add command is executed
